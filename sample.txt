This is every day they can subscribe to so you have few people who take the whole booking they do provisioning they do emit distribution they they do the whole shebang some only do imagination right so the subscription model that existed within ngi has been pretty well received by people and we thought that you know since we were redoing the UI why don't we look at extending this to services even beyond NGA that are immediate thought was that at the time we were doing this that you know how can enterprise engineering leverage a subscription model for services such as ldap blah blah blah blah blah hence we thought of moving CPM out putting it into the secure subscription or the service subscription hub application and essentially offer a subscription portal where people could could onboard services and be able to manage those services for their customer base so that was basic idea of how SH came up as far as BPMS come you know comes it's essentially driven by two things one was that you know we are seeing people that the customers of Ng I leverage cost benefits by the ability of GI to be able to schedule downtime you know schedule their host to be bought when they're not using them and the you know question came that OK and yeah right now is very focused towards managing only those systems that are provisioned through it so the obvious solution you know question came up we have cost of cost of cloud being a very burning issue why don't we how can we extend this cost savings thing to other non GI started something and that was what formed the the genesis for make up for conceiving the Start Stop service so essentially what Ng has what what the scheduling service and GI does start short does for non Ng manage hosts and given the fact that you know you are starting and stopping scheduling rebooting a host via Start Stop it it met it it meant that there is a logical you know sort of common ground between the stuff that was being done for starstruck for OC managed hosts with the stuff that DC was doing for non OC managers which is on you know on Prem stuff which then made it a point that's listened ECM has to move out it it it has to be moved into a new architecture a new UI new platform right why don't we consolidate these two and that was where BPMS came and so BPMS gives you the ability to realize cost savings for non GI managed hosts uh it it provides a centralized scheduling mechanism that can be used by Ng I or any other service if they need a scheduler right they can look at the the BPMS based scheduler for this thing then I would also point out that on the oci has scheduling but the advantages of RPMS based feeling is XYZ talk about those advantages of PMS based scheduling and finally you know coming to the Third Point which is the AI companion the way I would pitch it to it is telling him that listen Ng is doing good good job but it definitely is not as resilient in terms of you know being failure proof as OC I is when you provision an OC I I have still not encountered a case where my provisioning has failed but the same can't be said about India then there's a lot of time that you know our Sr. team spends every day we we receive you know numerous requests from people trying to figure out why they're provisioning failed so we were thinking of you know we we have advantages that are you know sort of prevailing these days in January so we thought it logical why can't we move personal time which is the time that jagdish or swarna or or or anyone else spends trials this move person time to machine time we we leverage agentic AI approaches and when sleep you know be be able to proactively find out when an error occurs and before the user can even get to us we have done the background work to tell the user that the SIM this is the problem that has come you're sorry about it and this is the reason why it's come we've already taken steps to reach out to the concerned teams with your your issue right now if it's the case of imaging right if there is stuff that can be done proactively we've already done it otherwise if there's something that that needs a ticket we've already gone ahead and raise the ticket or we've already posted the message so the end user experience is much different to what it is right now there there's their experience is right now is very reactive we're moving that tattoo through active mode and you know who knows if this thing picks up with the AI platform coming in we can even have this generic AI platform as one of the services that can be subscribed to who does SSH portal so that is the way I would essentially
